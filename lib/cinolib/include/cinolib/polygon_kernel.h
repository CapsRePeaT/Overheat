/* Computes the kernel of a 2D polygon (the locus of points which are

 * Library.
 *
 * For each oriented edge in the polygon we generate a big enough quad
 * representing the positive half-space, and we then intersect all the
 * positive half-spaces together using boolean operations.
 *
 * Polygon representation: a polygon is a vector of points ordered CCW to
 * form a closed loop (first and last points are adjacent).
 *
 * The function returns the area of the kernel (i.e. 0 means the polygon has no kernel)
