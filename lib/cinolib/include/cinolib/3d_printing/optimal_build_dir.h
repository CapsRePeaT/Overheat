/* This metod returns the optimal build orientation for 3D printing according to
 * a linear combination of four typical metrics, that is:
 *
 *  - part height          => mimimizes part height along the build direction,
 *                            reducing the amount of slices hence decreasing printing time
 *
 *  - shadow area          => minimizes the footprint in the printing bed
 *                            (useful for packing multiple objects)
 *
 *  - support contact area => minimize the overhanging surface that necessitates external supports,
 *                            this counts also the area of upfacing triangles that have some overhang
 *                            above them and will be the "basis" for external supports
 *
 *  - supports volume      => minimizes the voume of external supports, thus reducing
 *                            the amount of material necessary to complete the print
 *
 * The algorithm is pretty straightforward: candidate directions are evenly sampled
 * from the unit sphere. For each candidate build direction these four metrics are
 * evaluated. The output result is the direction that minimizes the energy.
 *
 * Users can choose how many directions should be tested, and what is the importance of
 * each metric in the global energy.
 *
 * Forbidden dirs: users can indicate one or more build directions that are forbidden.
 * These will not be evaluated by the algorithm. Forbidden dirs are represented by a
 * direction vector and a cone angle (in degrees). Each candidate build direction that
 * falls within a forbidden cone will receive infinite energy and will therefore be
 * discarded.
 *
 * Critical surfaces: users can indicate portions of the surface that are critical,
 * for example because they require higher finish than other parts. Critical surfaces
 * are passed in input in the form of a vector of triangle indices. When calculating
 * the support contact area, the area of critical surfaces touched by a support structure
 * will be multiplied by a boost factor, in order to count more than the other regular
 * surface elements.
