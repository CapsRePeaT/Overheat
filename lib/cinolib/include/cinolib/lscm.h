/* Compute a Least Squares Conformal Map (LSCM). Here LSCM is implemented
 * as described in Section 2.2 of:
 *
 * Spectral Conformal Parameterization
 * Patrick Mullen, Yiying Tong, Pierre Alliez, Mathieu Desbrun
 * Symposium on Geometry Processing, 2008
 *
 * which is shown to be equivalent to the original formulation, presented in:
 *
 * Least Squares Conformal Maps for Automatic Texture Atlas Generation
 * Bruno Levy, Sylvain Petitjean, Nicolas Ray, JÃ©rome Maillot
 * ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2002
 *
 * The function returns a 2 x #V scalar field containing the
 * serialized UV mesh coordinates (i.e. {u0,u1,..,un,v0,v1,..,vn}).
 *
 * NOTE: if the (at least two) required Dirichlet boundary conditions are
 * not provided in input by the user, they will be automatically selected
 * as the furthest pair of points along the boundary of the shape.
